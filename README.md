# VGG16_predict_picture_class
use pytorch with vgg16 to predict picture classes

Run program by yourself:
1.change TRAIN_DATA_PATH and TEST_DATA_PATH to the path of your traindata and testdata(the direct name is the label, that is very simple)
2.run python3 vgg_successful.py

You can try:
1. Change optimizer as you want. Maybe there will be a better to train your dataset.
2. You also can change the learning rate and epoch to let your model to be better.
